From 12 to 13:
* The per console verbose level feature as previously implemented caused a
  large performance penalty.  The fix required some minor incompatibilities
  if the new rasterisk is used to connect to an earlier version.  If the new
  rasterisk connects to an older Asterisk version then the root console verbose
  level is always affected by the "core set verbose" command of the remote
  console even though it may appear to only affect the current console.  If
  an older version of rasterisk connects to the new version then the
  "core set verbose" command will have no effect.

CLI commands:
 - "core show settings" now lists the current console verbosity in addition
   to the root console verbosity.

 - "core set verbose" has not been able to support the by module verbose
   logging levels since verbose logging levels were made per console.  That
   syntax is now removed and a silence option added in its place.

Configuration Files:
 - The 'verbose' setting in logger.conf still takes an optional argument,
   specifying the verbosity level for each logging destination.  However,
   the default is now to once again follow the current root console level.
   As a result, using the AMI Command action with "core set verbose" could
   again set the root console verbose level and affect the verbose level
   logged.

 - The manager.conf 'eventfilter' now takes an "extended" regular expression
   instead of a "basic" one.

Realtime Configuration:
 * New columns have been added to realtime tables for 'support_path' on
   ps_registrations and ps_aors and for 'path' on ps_contacts for the new
   SIP Path support in chan_pjsip.
 * The following new tables have been added for pjsip realtime: 'ps_systems',
   'ps_globals', 'ps_tranports', 'ps_registrations'.
 * The following columns were added to the 'ps_aors' realtime table:
   'maximum_expiration', 'outbound_proxy', and 'support_path'.
 * The following columns were added to the 'ps_contacts' realtime table:
   'outbound_proxy' and 'path'.
 * New columns have been added to the ps_endpoints realtime table for the
   'media_address', 'redirect_method' and 'set_var' options.  Also the
   'mwi_fromuser' column was renamed to 'mwi_from_user'.
 * WARNING: The database migration script that adds the 'extensions' table for
   realtime had to be modified due to an error when installing for MySQL.  The
   'extensions' table's 'id' column was changed to be a primary key.  This could
   potentially cause a migration problem.  If so, it may be necessary to
   manually alter the affected table/column to bring it back in line with the
   migration scripts.
