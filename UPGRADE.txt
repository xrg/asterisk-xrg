=== UPGRADE-1.6.txt -- Upgrade info for 1.4 to 1.6
===========================================================

From 1.6.0.1 to 1.6.1:

* The ast_agi_register_multiple() and ast_agi_unregister_multiple()
  API calls were added in 1.6.0, so that modules that provide multiple
  AGI commands could register/unregister them all with a single
  step. However, these API calls were not implemented properly, and did
  not allow the caller to know whether registration or unregistration
  succeeded or failed. They have been redefined to now return success
  or failure, but this means any code using these functions will need
  be recompiled after upgrading to a version of Asterisk containing
  these changes. In addition, the source code using these functions
  should be reviewed to ensure it can properly react to failure
  of registration or unregistration of its API commands.

* The ast_agi_fdprintf() API call has been renamed to ast_agi_send()
  to better match what it really does, and the argument order has been
  changed to be consistent with other API calls that perform similar
  operations.

From 1.6.0.x to 1.6.1:

* The following core commands dealing with dialplan have been deprecated: 'core
  show globals', 'core set global' and 'core set chanvar'. Use the equivalent
  'dialplan show globals', 'dialplan set global' and 'dialplan set chanvar'
  instead.

* In the dialplan expression parser, the logical value of spaces
  immediately preceding a standalone 0 previously evaluated to
  true. It now evaluates to false.  This has confused a good many
  people in the past (typically because they failed to realize the
  space had any significance).  Since this violates the Principle of
  Least Surprise, it has been changed.

* While app_directory has always relied on having a voicemail.conf or users.conf file
  correctly set up, it now is dependent on app_voicemail being compiled as well.

* SIP: All of the functionality in SIPCHANINFO() has been implemented in CHANNEL(),
  and you should start using that function instead for retrieving information about
  the channel in a technology-agnostic way.

* If you have any third party modules which use a config file variable whose
  name ends in a '+', please note that the append capability added to this
  version may now conflict with that variable naming scheme.  An easy
  workaround is to ensure that a space occurs between the '+' and the '=',
  to differentiate your variable from the append operator.  This potential
  conflict is unlikely, but is documented here to be thorough.
