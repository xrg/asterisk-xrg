=== Information for upgrading between Asterisk 1.6 versions
===
=== These files document all the changes that MUST be taken

=== versions listed below. These changes may require that
=== you modify your configuration files, dialplan or (in
=== some cases) source code if you have your own Asterisk
=== modules or patches. These files also includes advance
=== notice of any functionality that has been marked as
=== 'deprecated' and may be removed in a future release,
=== along with the suggested replacement functionality.

From 1.6.0.9 to 1.6.0.10:

* Support for Taiwanese was incorrectly supported with the "tw" language code.
  In reality, the "tw" language code is reserved for the Twi language, native
  to Ghana.  If you were previously using the "tw" language code, you should
  switch to using either "zh" (for Mandarin Chinese) or "zh_TW" for Taiwan
  specific localizations.

From 1.6.0.1 to 1.6.0.2:

* The ast_agi_register_multiple() and ast_agi_unregister_multiple()
  API calls were added in 1.6.0, so that modules that provide multiple
  AGI commands could register/unregister them all with a single
  step. However, these API calls were not implemented properly, and did
  not allow the caller to know whether registration or unregistration
  succeeded or failed. They have been redefined to now return success
  or failure, but this means any code using these functions will need
  be recompiled after upgrading to a version of Asterisk containing
  these changes. In addition, the source code using these functions
  should be reviewed to ensure it can properly react to failure
  of registration or unregistration of its API commands.

* The ast_agi_fdprintf() API call has been renamed to ast_agi_send()
  to better match what it really does, and the argument order has been
  changed to be consistent with other API calls that perform similar
  operations.
